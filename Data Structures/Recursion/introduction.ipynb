    "Consider the problem of calculating $\\mathtt{2^5}$. Let's assume to calculate this, you need to do one multiplication after another. That's $2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2$. We know that $2^5 = 2 * 2^4$. If we know the value of $2^4$, we can easily calculate $2^5$.\n",

The recursive solution is to calculate $2 * 2^{n-1}$ for all n that is greater than 0. If n is 0, return 1. We'll ignore all negative numbers.\n",
