    "While dealing with a \"compound\" object, a simple copy operation might not work as expected. You would need a function that can create a deep copy. For this purpose, you can make use of `deepcopy()` function from the `copy` module in Python. This module provides the function for normal (Shallow) and deep copy operations.
